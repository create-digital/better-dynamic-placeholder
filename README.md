# Better Dynamic Placeholder
A Better Dynamic Placeholder Solution for Sitecore 8

# Summary
Works just like the typical Dynamic Placeholders solution - but assigns each rendering an ID so that placeholder names are consistent when moved around.

# Blog Post
I'm in the process of writing a blog post that will go up on http://www.createdigital.com - I'll update the readme when it's up.

# What doesh't this fix?
I consider this a huge improvement on the current solution, but there are still a few pieces that this solution doesn't address.  
- Multiple placeholders of the same name within the same rendering
- Moving an item to a different level with children
- Removing nested children when a parent is deleted
